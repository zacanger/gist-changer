Democracy is the road to socialism.
From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.
The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
The last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope.
The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.
The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them.
The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.
The product of mental labor — science — always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production.
The proletarians have nothing to loose but their chains. They have a world to win.
The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs.
There must be something rotten in the very core of a social system which increases its wealth without diminishing its misery.
To be radical is to grasp things by the root.
We should not say that one man’s hour is worth another man’s hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing: he is at the most time’s carcass.
Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.
